## ⚡ How It Works

- The sidebar (`aside`) starts collapsed. Click the ☰ button to expand it (shows links), or ✖ to collapse.
- Layout uses CSS Grid to organize header, sidebar, main, and footer areas.
- **Main Content:**  
  - The left-side panel (`aside#sideMainPanel`) contains details or extra info.
  - The right sections (`#Section1`, `#Section2`) display main page content.
- Responsive for all screen sizes.

## 🌟 Quick Start

1. **Clone or download the repository.**
2. **Open `index.html` in your browser.**
3. **Try the sidebar toggle and resize your window** to see the fully responsive layout in action.
