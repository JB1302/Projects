## ⚡ How It Works

- The sidebar (`aside`) contains navigation links.
- By default, the sidebar is expanded. Clicking the ☰ button toggles the `collapsed` class:
    - **Collapsed:** Sidebar shrinks and hides navigation links.
    - **Expanded:** Sidebar displays all options.
- The layout is fully responsive—on mobile, the sidebar adapts to the top and navigation switches to horizontal.

## 🌟 Quick Start

1. **Clone or download the repository**
2. **Open `index.html` in your browser** (no build or server needed)
3. **Try toggling the side panel** and resize your window to see the responsive behavior.

## ✨ Customization Ideas

- Add icons to the navigation menu.
- Integrate more sections or content into `<main>`.
- Animate menu links for a smoother UX.
- Connect the sidebar to dynamic page navigation in a larger app.
- Style with your own brand colors or fonts.
