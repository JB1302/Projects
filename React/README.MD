This folder collects my React-based UI projects: landing pages, layouts, and interactive prototypes.
Each project emphasizes reusable components, clean page structure, and responsive design.

- **Responsive UI** patterns for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Modern React tooling** using Vite or Create React App depending on the project.
